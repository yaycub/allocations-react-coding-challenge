# Allocations React Coding Challenge

Using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/documentation), we would like you to create a React application that allows you to search through a list of characters/people in the Star Wars universe.

Use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to initialize your application.

## Submitting your challenge

Send an email with a GitHub repo link containing your solution to `ryan.mehta@allocations.com`.

## Requirements

- Each list item should consist of the character's name, gender, hair color, mass, and height.
- The list should be styled in a way that makes each entry distinct.
- The list should be searchable by the character's name.
- The list should have pages (the maximum amount of entries on a page should be 10).
- The displayed list should be displayed alphabetically.
- Below the list, display the average height and average mass of the characters in your list (calculate this using the reduce method).

## (EXAMPLE)

## Luke Skywalker

- ### Gender: Male
- ### Hair Color: Blond
- ### Height: 172
- ### Mass: 77

## C-3PO

- ### Gender: n/a
- ### Hair Color: n/a
- ### Height: 167
- ### Mass: 75

#### Average Height: 170

#### Average Mass: 76
